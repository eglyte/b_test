# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

Build the simple holding page for Icon; artwork for desktop, tablet and phone included. No requirements on CSS or JS - use what ever you want to. Build the page however you would naturally do it.

*Points to note

** “Leeds starts here” is not a link
** Keep up to date link should open a pop up box to add a name and email address. This would link to MailChimp but this doesn’t not need to be done as part of the test.
** Play Video should open video in a pop up box (auto play maybe?) This could run locally or use a streaming service. 
** Background image - would be nice to be an image carousel which fades between the supplied images
** At desktop size it would be nice for the site to fill the viewport size then scroll at smaller screen sizes.

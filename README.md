This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

Build the simple holding page for Icon. No requirements on CSS or JS.

* Points to note

  * “Leeds starts here” is not a link
  * Keep up to date link should open a pop up box to add a name and email address. This would link to MailChimp but this doesn’t not need to be done as part of the test.
  * Play Video should open video in a pop up box (auto play maybe?) This could run locally or use a streaming service. 
  * Background image - would be nice to be an image carousel which fades between the supplied images
  * At desktop size it would be nice for the site to fill the viewport size then scroll at smaller screen sizes.
